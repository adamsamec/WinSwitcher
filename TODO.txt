# TODO
* Solve the issue of Win + F12 or Win + F11 conflicting with the foreground app shortcuts, such as in Microsoft Word or Total commander, where WinSwitcher cannot be invoked.
* Some apps cannot be switched to, e.g. the modern ones.
* Filter results announcements.
* Window and app closing functionality.
